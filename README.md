# SQL-Data-Cleaning

In this project I take a look at raw housing data from Nashville, Tennessee and transform it using SQL Server to make it more usable for analysis. 

The transformations consist of the following:
- Standardize Date Format
- Populate Address Data
- Breaking out one column into several ones
- Update values form the "Sold as Vacant" column
- Remove Duplicates
- Delete Unused Columns

The total amount of rows that I used in this project is 56,477 but the file that you can see in the folder contains less rows so you can see in a table format the types of data I worked with.
